## brashlib

`brashlib` is a sourceable `bash` include file that provides some core functions, mostly for logging/output and argument parsing.

The expected path is `/usr/local/lib/brashlib`, with an include directory at `/usr/local/lib/brashlib.d`.

See the README in `src/brashlib.d` for information about the parsing library, `dispatch.sh`..
